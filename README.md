# Overview
This project aims to create a hand gesture-controlled car that can recognize hand commands to move perform four motions of the robot. It uses a Pi camera to capture hand gestures, a Raspberry Pi 4 to interface with the Pi camera and translate detected hand gestures into commands that are sent to a server run by an MBED (using a ESP8266 module).
