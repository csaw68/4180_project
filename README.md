# Overview
This project aims to create a hand gesture-controlled car that can recognize hand commands to move and perform four motions. It uses a Pi camera to capture hand gestures, a Raspberry Pi 4 to interface with the Pi camera and translate detected hand gestures into commands that are sent to a server run by an MBED (using a ESP8266 module). Finally, the MBED takes the commands and moves the robot accordingly.

# Hardware Setups

## Vehicle Setup
Instructions on how to assemble the vehicle's base build can be found here: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/assembly-guide-for-redbot-with-shadow-chassis/all

## Pin connection of the Pi

## Pin connection of the mbed

### The Pi sends data to the mbed over a wifi ESP8266 module (used in Lab 2). A server was established for their connection. In this case at address http://192.168.1.10/

# Table of Commands
The number of fingers held up by the user will determine the robotâ€™s movement.

| Number of fingers held up  | Robot movement |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Forward   |
| 2  | Reverse   |
| 3  | Right Turn|
| 4  | Left Turn |
